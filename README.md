# AnyChart Svelte 3 integration

This example shows how to use Anychart with Svelte 3.

The demo is based on the official Svelte [app template available on GitHub](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

## Getting started
To run this sample:

Clone the repository from github.com:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:anychart-integrations/anychart-svelte3.git
```

Navigate to the repository folder:
```bash
$ cd anychart-svelte3
```

Install all project requirements:
 ```bash
npm install
 ```

To create an optimised (production) version of the app:
```bash
npm run build
```

Since that, the demo can be launched in your browser:
```bash
npm run start
```

Now the web application is available on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
If the port is already busy check the terminal message for a new port.

To launch the app in development mode with hot-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```
